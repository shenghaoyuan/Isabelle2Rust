# Isabelle2Rust

Isabelle2Rust generates safe Rust from executable Isabelle/HOL specifications.
Stage-1 translates Thingol into baseline Rust, and Stage-2 applies
ownership-aware source-to-source optimizations.

## 1. Environment

The artifact was evaluated with:

- Ubuntu 22.04 under WSL2
- Isabelle/HOL 2025
- Rust 1.94.0
- OCaml 4.11.2
- Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and 15 GiB memory

pkg-config --libs jansson     # contains -ljansson
```

Clone the two repositories into the required layout:

```bash
mkdir Isabelle2Rust-artifact
cd Isabelle2Rust-artifact

git clone https://github.com/OpenSourceVerif/RustLightAST.git
git -C RustLightAST checkout bec5b614d70afbb67041e12d800f7a8c2be502cc

git clone -b tosem-ae https://github.com/OpenSourceVerif/Isabelle2Rust.git
cd Isabelle2Rust
```

## 4. Quick Start

Run the complete two-stage pipeline on one Isabelle theory:

```bash
make test DIR=test/example Name=RBT_Test
```

`RBT_Test` matches the red-black-tree running example in the paper overview.

Here, `DIR` contains the theory and `Name` is its filename without `.thy`. The command
generates and compiles the Stage-1 crate, applies Stage-2 optimization, and then
compiles the Stage-2 crate. The generated crates are written to:

```text
<DIR>/stage1/<Name>/export*/
<DIR>/stage2/<Name>/export*/
```
Omitting `Name` processes every `*_Test.thy` under `DIR`.

## 5. Stage-1: Code Translation

Stage-1 performs a syntax-directed translation from Thingol to baseline Rust.

```bash
make gen DIR=test/example Name=RBT_Test
```

## 6. Stage-2: Code Optimization

Stage-2 applies ownership-aware source-to-source optimizations to the generated baseline
Rust program.

```bash
make opt DIR=test/example Name=RBT_Test
```

This command applies the complete Stage-2 pipeline to an existing Stage-1
export.

## 7. Evaluation

The following commands reproduce the complete evaluation. Experiments that may take several hours are noted below.

### 7.1 RQ1: Code-Generation Capability

We evaluate Isabelle2Rust using the rule-level Unit tests, the program-level FPP suite, and Isabelle/HOL's official library-scale HOL-Codegenerator_Test (HCT).

```bash
make test DIR=test/unit
make test DIR=test/fpp
make hol-stress
```

The scripts for collecting the generated Rust LOC and phase times reported in Table 1 are:

```bash
# Count generated Rust LOC
python3 evaluation/scripts/rq1/count-generated-loc.py

# Measure translation and optimization times
python3 evaluation/scripts/rq1/run-timings.py
```

### 7.2 RQ2: Behavioral Consistency

RQ2 uses differential testing at the program and instruction levels for SBPF and at the instruction level for x86-64.

#### SBPF-program

`make macro_sbpf` generates or reuses both Rust stages, then checks them and the OCaml export against native SBPF execution using 146 tests derived from Solana's official eBPF test suite.

```bash
# Run the 146 program-level tests
make macro_sbpf
# Success: each export reports Passed 146 / Failed 0 / Total 146,
# followed by Overall: PASS.
```

#### SBPF-instruction

`make micro_sbpf` generates or reuses both Rust stages, then checks them and the OCaml export against native SBPF execution using randomly generated instruction vectors. It uses 10,000 vectors by default; set `X` to change this number.

```bash
# Run 10,000 instruction-level tests
make micro_sbpf
# Run a custom number of tests
make micro_sbpf X=100000
# Success: each export reports Passed 10000 / Failed 0 / Total 10000
# for the default run, followed by Overall: PASS. With X set, the totals equal X.
```

#### x64-stepper

`make x64` generates or reuses both Rust stages, then checks them and the OCaml export against native x86-64 execution using randomly generated instruction vectors. It uses 10,000 vectors by default; set `X` to change this number.

```bash
# Run 10,000 instruction-level tests
make x64
# Run a custom number of tests
make x64 X=100000
# Success: each export reports Passed 10000 / Failed 0 / Total 10000
# for the default run, followed by Overall: PASS. With X set, the totals equal X.
```

Both SBPF and x86-64 reuse generated artifacts when the expected files are present and the relevant sources are unchanged. Set `REBUILD=1` to force regeneration.

The following scripts run the complete two-stage differential-testing campaigns over ten rounds of 100,000 vectors and may take many hours:

```bash
# Run the complete SBPF campaign
evaluation/scripts/rq2/run-sbpf-10x100k.sh
# Run the complete x86-64 campaign
evaluation/scripts/rq2/run-x64-10x100k.sh
```

### 7.3 RQ3: Optimization Effectiveness

RQ3 evaluates whether Stage-2 improves generated-code quality, runtime, and
heap allocation.

#### Code Quality

The following command compares Clippy diagnostics across the Stage-1 and
Stage-2 crates generated for the RQ1 test suites and RQ2 case studies.

```bash
make rq3-clippy
# Success: Recorded 93 crate pairs and 5900 -> 27 diagnostics in ...
```

The generated summary is written to
`evaluation/.work/rq3/code-quality/all/summary.csv`; the same directory also
records the run environment in `environment.json`.

#### Performance

The performance experiments compare Stage-1, full Stage-2, the Last-Use and
Borrow ablations, the Isabelle/HOL OCaml export, and the corresponding
case-study baseline.

```bash
# Measure SBPF-program on 146 tests and SBPF-instruction on 6,000 vectors
make rq3-sbpf
# Success: RESULT_DIR=.../evaluation/.work/rq3/sbpf/runs/<timestamp>

# Measure x64-stepper on 6,000 vectors
make rq3-x64
# Success: RESULT_DIR=.../evaluation/.work/rq3/x64/runs/<timestamp>
```

Each `RESULT_DIR` contains `environment.json`, an `experiment-record.md` with
the correctness results, and a `summary.csv` with three runtime and
heap-allocation measurements and their median. The paper reports the fixed
results and environments under
[`evaluation/results/rq3/`](evaluation/results/rq3/); rerun performance values
may vary with the execution environment.
